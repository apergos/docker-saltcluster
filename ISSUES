The files in salt/puppet-salt should get turned into a package
for remote install instead of living on local disk and being
ADDed to the base salt image.

getaddrinfo() in python 2.7 is busted with some of the hostnames
that Docker generates (those that are sequences of decimal digits).
This meant some kludges in pupaas.py which could probably be
handled better.

Docker and/or lxc don't seem to do well with multiple configures/stops
at the same time. Maybe it's a thread-safe issue, maybe something else.
Needs more investigation.  If that ever gets resolved, we should
be clever about how many threads get allocated for starts/configures/
stops/deletes based on load, number of processors, memory.

Why does memory use increase so dramatically over time for a running
(and doing virtually nothing) cluster?  lxc or docker memory leak
or something else?

Should provide for export and flattening of salt base image in
scripts.

ssh scripts should not depend on /usr/bin/bash for location of bash
since under ubuntu it's /bin/bash.

Should do better about installing ruby custom fact file in a
nice location.

The hacked libselinux lib needs testing in the case that folks
want selinux to work (I expect it does not).

Sometimes configuration of one or two minions fails.  This can
be worked around by configuring just the specific minion
but it's a PITA and should be debugged.

There's no nice way to terminate all the processes before
doing saltcluster --stop.

There ought to be a way to shut down all the pupaas processes
after configuration. (OK, you'll say, 'just run salt on it' :-P)

Be cleverer about the root password.  Maybe allow ssh keys,
who knows.  For a testbed it's ok this way I guess.

Have a nice way to update the base image from latest salt git
commit without rebuilding from scratch.

Use short forms of the tag in minion/master names when the
tag is $random-git-commit.
